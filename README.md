Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an macOS laptop for web development.

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely.
It installs, upgrades, or skips packages
based on what is already installed on the machine.

Requirements
------------

We support:

* macOS Mavericks (10.9)
* macOS Yosemite (10.10)
* macOS El Capitan (10.11)
* macOS Sierra (10.12)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Optionally, [install thoughtbot/dot***REMOVED***les][dot***REMOVED***les].

[dot***REMOVED***les]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/dot***REMOVED***les#install

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log ***REMOVED***le as an attachment.

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
***REMOVED***

brew bundle --***REMOVED***le=- <<***REMOVED***
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
***REMOVED***

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
***REMOVED***

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
***REMOVED***

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
***REMOVED***

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
***REMOVED***

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dot***REMOVED***les ..."
  rcup
***REMOVED***
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
